## e.     You are connected to the R4 router. Issue the traceroute command on the router using the address for b2server determined in step b. What is different about the traceroute command on the router compared to tracert on the PC?
```
The total hops from the router is 4 hops

R4#traceroute 128.107.64.254
Type escape sequence to abort.

### What is the significance of R4 to Sales?
```
This is the default gateway to the sales PC.
```

## f. Use the show ip interface brief command to display the status of the interfaces on R4. Based on the output of the command, which interface is used to reach the next device in the list output from the tracert command?
```
R4#show ip interface brief 
Interface              IP-Address      OK? Method Status                Protocol 
GigabitEthernet0/0     172.16.0.1      YES manual up                    up 
GigabitEthernet0/1     unassigned      YES unset  administratively down down 
Serial0/0/0            64.100.150.1    YES manual up                    up 
Serial0/0/1            unassigned      YES unset  up                    up 
Serial0/0/1.1          64.100.200.1    YES manual up                    up

```
### Answer
```
Serial0/0/0
```
## g. Telnet to the second IP address in the tracert list and log in. You can use the number in the far left column of the tracert output to track where you are in the list. What is the name of the device to which you are connected?
## Answer
```
Tier3a
```

## h. Issue the show ip route command and study the output. Referring to the list of codes at the beginning of the output, what are the different types of routes displayed in the routing table?
```
Tier3a>show ip route
Codes: L - local, C - connected, S - static, R - RIP, M - mobile, B - BGP
       D - EIGRP, EX - EIGRP external, O - OSPF, IA - OSPF inter area
       N1 - OSPF NSSA external type 1, N2 - OSPF NSSA external type 2
       E1 - OSPF external type 1, E2 - OSPF external type 2, E - EGP
       i - IS-IS, L1 - IS-IS level-1, L2 - IS-IS level-2, ia - IS-IS inter area
       * - candidate default, U - per-user static route, o - ODR
       P - periodic downloaded static route
